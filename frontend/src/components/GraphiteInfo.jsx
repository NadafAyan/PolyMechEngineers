            Graphite is being widely used in EDM mould making because of the
            following key advantages. Due to low wear it is time and cost
            effective. Easier machining with less complex milling tools. Perfect
            for high quality surface finishes and provides a high metal removal
            rate. It does not melt but sublimes (turns from a solid to a gas) at
            very high temperatures of 3400Â°C. It is five times less dense than
            Copper which means lighter electrodes. It is very resistant to
            thermal shock and can withstand high temperatures.

            At Polymech Engineers we guarantee only the finest selection of raw
            materials and ensure the precise control of production resources to
            provide unparalleled performance. Our graphite offers advantages
            which set it apart from the crowd. Due to its low coefficient of
            thermal expansion, geometric stability at high temperatures is
            guaranteed. The mechanical strength remains unaltered at high
            temperatures.
